<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment I implemented the code to rasterize triangles and render SVG images. I also enabled additional features/functionalities 
  such as supersampling, transformations, color interpolation, and sampling for texture mapping. Supersampling rendered the edges smoother 
  along the rasterized triangles. I learned about barycentric coordinates and used them to interpolate color in the rasterizations. Lastly, I 
  utilized mipmaps to implement different pixel and texture sampling methods which made anti-aliasing more efficient than supersampling.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="middle">Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>

<p>In this task, I enabled drawing triangles by implementing the  <code> rasterize_triangle() </code> function. 
  Triangle rasterization happens in the following steps:
  <ol>
    <li>
      For the inputs (triangle vertices), I found the minimum and maximum x and y values. These values were my bounding box.
    </li>
    <li>
      For every sample within the bounding box, I checked whether that center of sample pixel, <code> (x + 0.5, y + 0.5) </code> , 
	  is within the bounds of the triangle. 
	  I did this by implementing a helper method that uses barycentric coordinates to determine if a point is within a triangle.
	  I only sampled within the bounding box, which proves that my algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within 
	  the bounding box of the triangle.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the sample point is located within the given triangle coordinates, then I set the color of that pixel to the given color 
	  by calling the <code> fill_pixel() </code> function.
    </li>
  </ol>
    The results of <code>basic/test4.svg</code> are shown below.

<h2 align="middle">Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h2>
<p>
  In this task, I antialiased using supersampling. For each pixel, I took <code> sample_rate </code> 
  (a number - either 1, 4, 9, or 16) samples within the pixel and averaged those colors to 
  get the new color for the pixel. I expected this would make the pixels seem more blurred up close, but looking at 
  the supersampled rasterized image displayed cleared images without any jaggies. 


  <!-- For the data structure, we chose to use a large, higher-resolution sample buffer to store sub-pixel sampling values across different triangles, 
  and we only average the value when resolving to the frame buffer. 
  In this way, we avoid the loss of quality when a pixel is evaluated multiple times by different triangles 
  (i.e., on the border). 
  This comes with a higher memory cost that grows fast as the sampling rate increases. 
  We always resize when the sampling rate changes to keep only the needed memory. -->
</p>

<p>
  I implemented supersampling through the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    In the <code>set_sample_rate()</code> and <code>set_framebuffer_target()</code> functions, I resized  
	the <code>sample_buffer</code> from \(\text{width}*\text{height}\) to 
	\(\text{width}*\text{height}*\text{sample_rate}\) so it could contain all the sampling points 
	depending on the <code>sample_rate</code>. It is helpful to resize whenever the sampling rate is changed 
	so that the program only uses as much memory as it needs in <code>sample_buffer</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
	I nested 2 more for loops that would equidistantly sample \(\sqrt{\text{sample_rate}} \) subpixels each within a pixel, 
	hence a total of \(\sqrt{\text{sample_rate}} \ * \sqrt{\text{sample_rate}} \)  = \(\text{sample_rate} \) subpixels per pixel.
	If the sample point in the center of the subpixel is located within the bounds of the triangle (same method as Task 1), 
	the color of each subpixel is saved in the resized <code>sample_buffer</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
	To set the color of the pixel in the <code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> method, I summed to color values of all the 
	subpixels and divided by the <code>sample_rate</code> to get the average color for that pixel. I assigned the pixels' corresponding 
	color in the <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code> to display the image.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
	A problem I ran into was that the black frame rectangle for all images started to lighten as I increased the <code>sample_rate</code>.
	This was because <code>fill_pixel()</code> only set the color for one pixel in <code>sample_buffer</code> and it averaged out with the 
	neighboring white pixels and lightened. I fixed this problem by supersampling the edges of the frames as well by using a nested for loop 
	to update <code>sample_buffer</code> in <code>fill_pixel()</code> similar to how I implemented it in <code>rasterize_triangle()</code>. 
	This ensured that the black frame stayed the same color as I modified <code>sample_rate</code>. 
</p>

<p>
  This supersampling algorithm antialiased the rasterized triangles. 
  <code>basic/test4.svg</code> images are shown below when <code>sample_rate</code> is 1, 4, and 16. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
  As I increased the sampling rate the edges and vertices become more smooth and the pixels are connected, therefore removing the jaggies. 
  This higher resolution is observed because averaging the color of the pixel from its subpixels takes into account there 
  being more than one triangle in a pixel, and it blends in the colors to eliminate the jaggies.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Task 3: Transforms</h2>
<p>
  In my_robot.svg, (Figure my_robot.svg), I modified cubeman's arms and legs so it looks like 
  it is in the middle of doing a jumping jack. I also changed its color from red to dark blue.
  Both parts of both legs are scaled by lengthening them from 0.6 to 0.8, and are rotated 45 degrees outward. 
  Both arms are rotated 45 degrees upwards. And finally, there were some minor translations done to bring the 
  arms and legs closer to the torso.

<h2 align="middle">Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>

<p>
  Barycentric coordinates are geometric coordinates that describe a point in relation to a triangle. 
  They be seen as weights of the three vertices of a traingle, and determine the point's position.
  These coordinates are often denoted by alpha, beta, and gamma, and the three are constrained to sum to 1. 
  In Figure Rasterized Triangle below, for example, let's have alpha correspond to the red corner, beta to the blue corner, and 
  gamma to the green corner. If alpha is 1, and beta and gamma are both 0, then the point will be weighed entirely to the red corner 
  according to the system of equations for a point inside the triangle (x, y) and set of vertices {(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)}, 
  where x = alpha*x_0 + beta*x_1 + gamma*x_2 and y = alpha*y_0 + beta*y_1 + gamma*y_2. However, if alpha = beta = gamma, then for this 
  example, (x, y) would be directly in the center of the triangle.

<h2 align="middle">Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
<p>
	Pixel sampling is the process of determining the color of a pixel for an image by looking up a corresponding 
	color value in a texture map. Additionally, texture mapping allows applying a texture to a 3D object. 
	Using barycentric coordinates as discussed in Task 4, each point of a textured triangle can be mapped to uv 
	coordinates on the textured image.
</p>

<p>
	The two types of pixel sampling I implemented are nearest neighbor and bilinear:
</p>

<p>
	Nearest neighbor sampling selects the color of the nearest pixel in the texture map to the pixel being rendered. 
	Bilinear interpolation, on the other hand, calculates the color of a pixel based on the weighted sum of the four nearest 
	pixels in the texture map.
</p>

<div align="middle">
	<table style="width=100%">
	  <tr>
		<td>
		  <img src="images/texmap2sr1nearest.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
		  <figcaption align="middle"><code>texmap/test1.svg</code> when sample_rate = 1 and nearest neighbor sampling.</figcaption>

	  </tr>
	  <br>
	  <tr>
		  <td>
			  <img src="images/texmap2sr16nearest.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
			  <figcaption align="middle">
				  <code>texmap/test1.svg</code> when sample_rate = 16 and nearest neighbor sampling.

				  <code>texmap/test1.svg</code> when sample_rate = 16 and bilinear sampling.
			  </figcaption>
		  </td>
	  </tr>
	  <br>
	</table>
  </div>

<p>
	<code>texmap/test1.svg</code> demonstrates that bilinear sampling outperforms nearest neighbor sampling. Comparing the two for when 
	the <code>sample_rate = 1</code>, the lines for longitude and latitude appear to be smoother with bilinear sampling. Although setting 
	the <code>sample_rate = 16</code> drastically improves the smoothness for both sampling methods, bilinear sampling still 
	antialiases the lines better than nearest neighbor sampling by removing most of the jaggies. In comparison, the nearest 
	neighbor sampling rasterizes sharper images than the bilinear sampling, which makes images more blurred in an attempt to 
	antialias by filtering high frequencies.
</p>

<p>
	It can be noted that even though nearest neighbor sampling is fast and simple, however it can result in aliased artifacts when the 
	texture is magnified, as shown above. Bilinear sampling renders smoother and accurately, but is expensive in terms of compute relative 
	to nearest neighbor sampling and does not produce as sharp of an image. There will be a large difference between the two methods depending 
	on the magnification of the texture: nearest neighbor sampling can result in jaggies when magnified and loss of detail (texels) when minified, 
	but it is simpler. Bilinear sampling will produce a better and smoother result but is more expensive.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>

  <p>
    Level sampling is a technique to improve the rendering of textures on 3D models by mapping textures of 2D images 
	onto the surfaces of 3D models to give them more detail. The texture is stored and sampling is reduced. Then the level 
	of the mipmap is selected based on the level with the closest sampling rate. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I implemented level sampling for texture mapping by first determining <code>p_uv</code>, <code>p_dx_uv</code>, and <code>p_dy_uv</code> 
	as barycentric coordinates and setting them in the SampleParams struct. Then, I calculated the appropriate mipmap level using 
	the barycentric coordinates. I subtracted <code>p_uv</code> from both <code>p_dx_uv</code> and <code>p_dy_uv</code>, and then 
	scaled the results (2 2D Vectors) by another vector containing the width and height of the screen. I took the max norm of these 
	2 new vectors, and then log2(max norm) to calculate the level, clamping the result between 0 and the mipmap's max level.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the input level sampling method (LSM) is <code>L_ZERO</code>, then I call the corresponding pixel sampling method (PSM, which I discussed 
	in Task 5 above) with level 0. If the LSM is <code>L_NEAREST</code>, then I call the PSM with the level I calculated above. However, if the 
	LSM is <code>L_BILINEAR</code>, then I want to get a weighted averaged of calling the corresponding PSM with the calculated level rounded down 
	(floored) and rounded up (ceiled). The weights are determined by getting the difference of the calculated level and the floored/ceiled level.
  </p>

  <h3>Speed</h3>

  <p>
    In terms of speed, supersampling is the slowest since it requires sampling multiple points per pixel. Relative to supersampling, 
	pixel sampling is faster since it requires just three lerps to weight against sampling from four pixels. Level sampling is the fastest 
	of the three since at most it requires just one lerp to weight against sampling from two mipmap levels.
  </p>

  <h3>Memory Usage</h3>

  <p>
    For memory usage, supersampling requires the most memory because we store all our samples and supersamples in a <code>sample_buffer</code> 
	that is <code>sample_rate</code>x larger than the normal rasterization buffer. Level sampling is better in terms of memory since 
	mipmaps and their levels need to be stored somehow. Althought pixel sampling may require more lerps, there is no need for additional mipmap 
	storage since it is sampled with mipmap level 0. Therefore, pixel sampling has the most optimal memory usage.
  </p>

  <h3>Antialiasing Power</h3>

  <p>
    When it comes to antialiasing power, level sampling does not do as good of a job compared to the other two methods most likely because it 
	is efficient and simple in compute, only taking one lerp and sampling two mipmap levels max. Pixel sampling is better at a higher 
	<code>sample_rate</code>, because this allows more blur along the pixel boundaries. Supersampling has the strongest antialiasing power, 
	especially for edges, simply because it requires the most memory and sampling as the <code>sample_rate</code> increases!
  </p>

  <h3> Testing on my own .png file</h3>

  <p>Below we compare L_ZERO and L_NEAREST level sampling as well as P_NEAREST and P_LINEAR pixel sampling:</p>

  <div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/lzpn.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle"><code>house.svg</code>  - L_ZERO sample with P_NEAREST pixel sampling.</figcaption>
      </td>
	    <td>
        <img src="images/lzpl.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle"><code>house.svg</code> - L_ZERO sample with P_LINEAR pixel sampling.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/lnpn.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">
          <code>house.svg</code>  - L_NEAREST sample with P_NEAREST pixel sampling.
        </figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/lnpl.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">
          <code>house.svg</code> - L_NEAREST sample with P_LINEAR pixel sampling.
        </figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Above, it can be seen that L_NEAREST's use of another mipmap level helps antialias the pixels along the edges of triangles. 
  Additionally, P_LINEAR significantly helps blur and antialias the image even stronger, and also interpolates the textured pixels 
  in the image.
